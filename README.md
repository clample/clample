### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I've spent my career so far working on mobile application testing platforms, trying to make it easier to run tests for Android and iOS. I also recently finished a master's degree at the UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles, where I wrote my thesis about FPGA's. In particular I looked into _dynamic partial reconfiguration_, a feature which allows the configuration on an FPGA to be changed at runtime. If this is interesting to you, you're welcome to read more [here](https://clample.com/lample-thesis-evaluating-imact-of-reconfig-speed.pdf).

You might notice a lack of contributions on my GitHub account. That's in large part because I've been busy working on closed source projects and my master's degree. That said, I hope to work more on open source software in the future!
